# Lisa TOMASETTO 

- ðŸ”­ I earned my PhD in May 2025 on retrieving teleseismic body waves from oceanic storms (secondary microseisms).
- :mag: I will start a post-doctoral position in January 2026 at LOPS in Brest, France. There, I will use SWOT data and seismic data to better constrain sea-state hindcasts such as WAVEWATCHIII.  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python Packaging and Markdeep.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking for collaboration on Python packages for seismology and ambient noise in particular.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about secondary microseism modeling and cross-correlation at the global scale

- âš¡ Fun fact: I practice juggling, and siteswap rocks!
